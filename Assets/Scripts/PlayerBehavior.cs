// Merging logic
//bowling pin -> tennis ball -> baseball - > 8 ball -> hockey puck -> 
//basket ball - > soccer ball -> ball star -> bowling ball, football, Toxic waste?

//Logic needed 
//A list of each of the prefabs and variants
//instantiate and drop a random one in the list... or array
//Check if they are colliding with another prefab
//if they are another of the same type then merge them
//instantiate new one destroy old one

//Difficulty scaling? 
//You would need to track what the last prefab instantiated was
//if you are in late game make it a small percentage to drop one of the same type?
//Increase speed
//Drop automatically within a certain time , time goes lower while playing
